How to use git with the feature branch workflow
-----------------------------------------------

So you're going to develope a cool new feature.  Great! Here's how to do that::

1.  Create a new feature branch in your local repo.  git checkout -b <descriptiveBranchName>
2.  Make your changes on this branch.
3.  Stage your changes: git add <file1, file2, ect>
4.  commit your changes, and include a useful message: git commit -m "descriptive message goes here"
5.  Push your changes to the origin: git push origin <branchName>
6.  Create a pull request via web GUI.  This will alert other team members that you want to merge your changes into the origin.
7.  Don't merge your own PR (cardinal sin).  We want someone else to review and merge it for you.
